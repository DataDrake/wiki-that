# wiki-that
A custom MediaWiki parser which generates HTML partials for 
use in the Engineering Design Guide and Environment (EDGE),
developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology. This 
library does adapts the WikiMedia Foundation MediaWiki grammar
in order to support richer use of namespaces in a 
project-oriented system. It does not strive for full compatibilty
with MediaWiki proper.
