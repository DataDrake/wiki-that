Here is a large selection of examples for using ''semantic markup'' to make [[About Wiki|wiki nodes]] look nice and function well.

== Basic formatting ==

This describes how to modify text to make it stand out beyond normal font styles.

You can ''italicize text'' by putting 2 
apostrophes on each side. 

3 apostrophes will bold '''the text'''. 

5 apostrophes will bold and italicize 
'''''the text'''''.

(4 apostrophes don't do anything special
 -- there's just ''''one left over''''.)

A single newline
has no effect
on the layout.
But an empty line

starts a new paragraph.

== Organizing your writing ==

This section disusses how to arrange and organize text to make it more readable. A full discussion of tables is not given here, but a good reference is the [[wikipedia:Help:Table|Wikipedia article on tables]].

== Section headings ==

''Headings'' organize your writing into sections.
The Wiki software can automatically generate
a table of contents from them.

=== Subsection ===

Using more equals signs creates a subsection.

==== A smaller subsection ====

Don't skip levels, 
like from two to four equals signs.

Start with 2 equals signs not 1 
because 1 creates H1 tags
which should be reserved for page title.

* ''Unordered lists'' are easy to do:
** Start every line with a star.
*** More stars indicate a deeper level.
*: Previous item continues.
** A newline
* in a list  
marks the end of the list.
*Of course you can start again.

Another kind of list is a ''definition list'':
; Word : Definition of the word
; Here is a longer phrase that needs a definition
: Phrase defined
; A word : Which has a definition
: Also a second one
: And even a third

You can make horizontal dividing lines (----)
to separate text.

But you should usually use sections instead,
so that they go in the table of contents.

You can add footnotes to sentences using the ''ref'' tag -- this is especially good for citing a source.

References: <references/>

Links can have path information.

A leading slash "/" indicates absolute path in the
project's ''web space'', as in [[/public/Home]].

Relative paths can be created too. If you want to go
up one directory, use [[../Home]]

with a "piped link". Put the link target first,
then the pipe character "|", then the link text.

Or you can use the "pipe trick" so that only the
node name is displayed.

== Images ==

Image linking and display are explained in [[Image Examples]].

== Citation of Sources ==

Citation is explained in-depth in [[Citation Examples]].

== Non-wiki Formatting ==

The following examples cannot have their sources shown properly because the tools used precede the <tt>pre</tt> tags used to display the markup source.
To 'fix' this, the tags used in the "What you type" column have spaces inserted after the opening left bracket (''eg.'' "<this" must be shown as "< this").
